* Up casting Assigning an instance of a subclass to a reference variable of a superclass
* This is automatically allowed by the ABAP runtime as the superclass reference provides a "less specific" view,
* which is always compatible with the "more specific" subclass object.
    plane = passenger.


    out->write( 'Output using superclass object reference' ).
    out->write( plane->get_attributes( ) ).


* Can't use the superclass reference to get the number of seats of the
* passenger plane, because the relevent method isn't declared in the superclass.


* plane->get_seats( ).


* Can't assign the plane directly to a passenger plane reference variable, because
* not every plane is a passenger plane.


*passenger = plane.

* Downcasting (Widening Cast): Assigning an instance of a superclass to a reference variable of a subclass.
* This is not automatically allowed at compile time because the subclass reference provides a "more specific" view of the object
* To perform a downcast, you must use the casting operator (?= or the CAST operator in modern ABAP syntax)

* Make sure the plane is actually a passenger plane, then force the cast.
    IF plane IS INSTANCE OF lcl_passenger_plane.
*      passenger = CAST #( plane ).
*      cargo ?= plane .
      cargo = CAST #( plane ).
